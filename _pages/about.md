About Me

Hey! I’m Austin Pyne, a tech enthusiast who loves coding, game development, and making music. This is where I share what I’m working on and exploring.

A Little About Me

I enjoy diving into programming, game design, and digital creativity. I love building things from scratch, experimenting with sound, and turning ideas into projects I can share with others.

My Interests

Coding & Development: Web apps, game mechanics, small projects, or anything I can build with code.

Games: Playing, designing, and sometimes modding video games.

Music: Composing, producing, or just exploring new sounds and instruments.

Projects: Anything that combines tech, creativity, and fun.

Fun Extras

I like mixing my hobbies together — coding music tools, building game mods, or creating interactive experiences. It’s all about learning, experimenting, and making things that are fun and hands-on.

Thanks for stopping by!
