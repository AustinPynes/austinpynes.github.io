About Me

Hey! I’m Austin Pyne, a passionate tech enthusiast who loves coding, game development, and making music. This is my personal space to share my projects, hobbies, and everything I’m experimenting with. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology and creativity can come together to build experiences that are both fun and meaningful, and this website is where I document that journey.

My Journey

I’ve been drawn to technology for as long as I can remember. The thrill of seeing code come to life on a screen, or a project I built start working exactly as I imagined, is something that has always motivated me. Over time, I discovered that coding wasn’t just about logic — it could also be a tool for creativity. This realization opened the door to game development, music production, and interactive experiences, blending technical skills with artistic expression.

I spend my time exploring different programming languages, frameworks, and tools, always learning something new and challenging myself with bigger projects. I love taking ideas from concept to completion, whether it’s a small web app, a mod for a video game, or an experimental music tool I coded myself.

Coding & Development

Coding is more than just a hobby — it’s a way for me to solve problems, create, and experiment. I enjoy building web apps, game mechanics, and small software projects, and I’m constantly experimenting with new frameworks, languages, and tools. Some of my favorite coding experiences include:

Designing interactive games from scratch, testing mechanics, and tweaking gameplay to make it fun and engaging.

Building tools for music production, like small apps or scripts that generate beats, manipulate sound, or help with composition.

Exploring web development projects, creating personal websites, interactive portfolios, and other web-based tools.

For me, coding is never just about writing lines of code — it’s about building something that works, looks good, and gives people an experience they enjoy.

Games

Video games have always been a huge part of my life, not just as a player, but as a creator. I enjoy designing, modding, and experimenting with games to see how small changes in mechanics, graphics, or storytelling can completely transform the player experience.

I’ve worked on game mods, custom levels, and experimental projects that explore new gameplay ideas. I love analyzing game mechanics, understanding what makes a game addictive or fun, and then using that knowledge to design my own mechanics. Whether it’s a casual puzzle game, a complex RPG, or a fast-paced platformer, games are one of my favorite ways to combine creativity and technical skill.

Music

Music is another big part of my life. I enjoy composing, producing, and experimenting with sounds. I’m fascinated by how music can evoke emotions, tell stories, or even enhance a gaming experience. My musical journey overlaps a lot with my coding and development work:

I sometimes code small music tools or apps to experiment with new sounds.

I love producing beats and melodies, whether for games, personal projects, or just for fun.

I explore different genres and styles, constantly learning and pushing myself to try new techniques.

Music gives me a creative outlet, and combining it with coding allows me to blend technology and art in ways that feel unique and personal.

Projects

Projects are where all of my interests converge. I love creating things that combine technology, creativity, and problem-solving. Some projects are experimental, some are polished, and some are just fun side experiments, but all of them help me learn and grow.

For example:

Developing interactive experiences that mix game mechanics with music.

Building small apps and tools to automate tasks or explore creative ideas.

Working on collaborative projects with friends or online communities to learn new skills and share knowledge.

Every project teaches me something new — about coding, design, sound, or teamwork. I enjoy the process as much as the final product, and I always look forward to the next challenge.

Fun Extras

Beyond coding, games, and music, I love exploring ideas, experimenting with new technologies, and learning for the sake of curiosity. I enjoy:

Combining hobbies — like creating a game with a custom soundtrack I produced myself.

Experimenting with interactive tools that mix visuals, sound, and gameplay.

Sharing knowledge and experiences with others, whether it’s tutorials, demos, or simply chatting about cool new things I’ve learned.

For me, creativity is limitless, and I’m always looking for new ways to push boundaries and try unusual combinations.
